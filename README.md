Syllabus

Course on convolutional neural network design applied to robust reading on images. The term Robust Reading represents the area of research related to the interpretation of written communication in unrestricted environments. Recently Robust Reading has been handled with great success by convolutional neural networks with end-to-end training. This course covers the main convolutional networks models used in the detection and reading of text in images. The course will use advanced Python/NumPy programming using the Deep Learning PyTorch package. Prior experience in matrix programming such as Python/Numpy or MATLAB or R is recommended and it is desirable to have basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Image Processing.
